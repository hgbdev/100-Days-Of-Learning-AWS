# 100 days of learning AWS
## Overview
- On this journey, I follow this course [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03 | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/)

## Progess update

### Day 1
- 🌎 Regions & Availability Zones: Understanding the AWS global infrastructure.
- 🔀 AWS Services by Region: Tailoring solutions based on geographic availability.
- 💰 Price Variations: Remember, costs can differ between AWS regions.
- 🛠️ Service Availability: Not all AWS services are offered in every region.

### Day 2
Today's dive into AWS IAM was illuminating! 🗝️ Here's what I absorbed:

- Users & Groups: Structuring user access.
- Policies: Defining permissions.
- Roles: Empowering EC2 instances & AWS Services.
- Security: Strengthening with MFA & Password Policy.
- AWS CLI & SDK: Navigating programmatically.
- Access Keys: Enabling programmatic access.
- Audit: IAM Credential Reports & Access Advisor.

Best IAM practices I'm taking to heart:
- Root account limited to setup.
- One user = One AWS user.
- Group-based permissions.
- Robust password policy.
- MFA for enhanced security.
- Roles for AWS services.
- Access Keys for programmatic access.
- Audit using Reports & Access Advisor.
- IAM users & Access Keys stay private.
